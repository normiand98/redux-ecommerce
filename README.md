- **MongoDB** (Local installation or a cloud MongoDB instance)

## How to Run the App Using Gitpod

To set up and run this project in a Gitpod workspace, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   - In your Gitpod workspace terminal, clone the repository:
     ```bash
     git clone https://github.com/0xiammatrixx/redux-bounty.git
     ```

2. **Install Node.js**:
   - If Node.js is not pre-installed in your Gitpod environment, install it with:
     ```bash
     sudo apt install nodejs
     ```

3. **Install npm**:
   - Install npm (Node package manager) if not available:
     ```bash
     sudo apt install npm
     ```

4. **Install MongoDB**:
   - To install MongoDB in your Gitpod environment:
     ```bash
     npm install mongodb
     ```

5. **Install Project Dependencies**:
   - Navigate to the project directory and install the required dependencies:
     ```bash
     cd redux-bounty
     npm install
     ```

6. **Run the Frontend**:
   - From the project root directory, start the frontend:
     ```bash
     npm run dev
     ```

7. **Run the Backend**:
   - In a new terminal, go to the `backend` directory to start the backend server:
     ```bash
     cd redux-bounty
     cd backend
     npm start
     ```

8. **Access the App**:
   - Once the app is running, Gitpod will provide you with a public URL. You can access the app via that URL.
   - Go to PORTS in your terminal area and make sure both ports are set to public
   - Open both links, typically, your backend will run on port 5000 and your frontend will run on port 5173
   - You can now interact with the frontend of the app.
